vec = zeros(50,50);
for i=14:50
    for j=1:50
        vec(i,j)=sheryan(i,j);
    end
end

%harrison u should do i from 20 to 25, ill do 25 to 30, the comp upstairs  started from 14 but it wont get farther then 20 i think.
%once eugene gets in he can do 30 to 35. I wanna get it to 50, so we can see a lot of numbers but the higher the num of weights
#the longer the computations
