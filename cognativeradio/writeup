We use hashtable to quickly look up which modulation schemes to use depending on which SNR we are transmitting at. Also, there is a vector of previously predicted SNR values in this iteration of which we take the mode in order to more accurately predict the SNR we should use. 
Because the connection between the receiver and the transmitter is limited to 8 bits, we had to choose whether we would want more freedom on where to jump in between channels or whether we want to be able to tell which SNR were transmitting on more accurately. After testing both cases, we realized that sending a more accurate SNR and thus using a more proper modulation scheme with proper values for n and k for BCH, we got better results.
The cognitive strategies we tried was predicting whether someone was in our channel, and then randomly jumping out of the channel, but realized that that is basically equivalent to just randomly jumping to different channels on each transmission. If whoever we are going up against is employing some time of evasive strategy, then the only things that would matter would be the team who optimized the modulation scheme and the coderate. But if the opponent is jamming us, then we realized the best way is to jump to a random channel since that is not predictable so its impossible to predict the next channel where we will be. The only way to combat randomness is to just flood all channels simultaneously, but if someone does that, then they will decimate the power of their signal and not be able to detect their own bits sent.
